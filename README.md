MediaPipe Solutions provides a suite of libraries and tools for you to quickly apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in your applications. You can plug these solutions into your applications immediately, customize them to your needs, and use them across multiple development platforms. MediaPipe Solutions is part of the MediaPipe open source project, so you can further customize the solutions code to meet your application needs.


Using this method, you can calculate the angles for each frame in the video, allowing you to analyze movement throughout the entire duration. For each frame, key joint positions are identified, and angles are computed using these points. These angles are then stored in a list over time.

Once the video has been fully processed, you can plot a graph where the X-axis represents the frame number (or time) and the Y-axis represents the calculated angles. This visualizes the movement, showing how the angles of different joints change over time, providing a clear insight into the motion dynamics.

This approach is useful for motion analysis, whether itâ€™s for sports, medical evaluations, or biomechanics studies.
